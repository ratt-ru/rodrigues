new forms should be put in this directory.

The name of the form is the filename.

Each file should contain:

  * A form_utils.forms.BetterForm subclass named Form

  * A variable CONTAINER with the name of the docker container to run



EXAMPLE:

"""
from django.forms import CharField
from form_utils.forms import BetterForm

CONTAINER = 'ubuntu'


class Form(BetterForm):
    name = CharField()

    def is_valid(self):
        super(Form, self).is_valid()

        # add more form validation here
"""
